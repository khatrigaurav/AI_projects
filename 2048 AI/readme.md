2048 is a board game. It contains a board with numbered tiles and empty tiles,with numbered tiles spawning in random after each turn. All you need to do is add the two tiles with the same number. The two tiles with the same number will merge or add up. Think and strategize to get the highest score. 

Here I have implemented an AI that uses 4 different heuristics(Monotonicity, Smoothness, Emptiness and Max) to get the high score in "PlayerAI.py".
Folder "StarterCode" contains all the necessasry supporting functions if you decide to construct your own AI.
